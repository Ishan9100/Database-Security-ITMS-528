## Overview

The **Database Security and Compliance Implementation** project aims to design and implement a database system that complies with NIST Special Publication 800-53 regulations. This project serves as a learning opportunity to deepen understanding of database security, compliance, and efficient project administration. The implementation includes a comprehensive project management plan, robust data encryption techniques, and a MySQL database with stringent security measures. By incorporating NIST SP 800-53 measures, the project underscores the commitment to industry-standard security requirements.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were used in this project:
- MySQL
- GNUPG
- SQL Workbench
- Project Libre / Microsoft Project (for Project Management)
- Ubuntu

## Implementation Details

The database is designed with interconnectivity and smart design to enhance efficiency and functionality. It consists of seven essential tables, each serving a specific function critical to the E-Learning Platform. These tables are designed for flexibility and future expansion, with over a thousand entries to accurately depict database utilization.

## Access Controls Implemented

The project implements the following NIST SP 800-53 access controls:
1. AC-02 Account Management | Privileged User Accounts
2. AC-05 Separation of Duties
3. AC-08 System Use Notification
4. AC-07 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts | Automatic Account Lock
5. AT-04 Security Training Records
6. AU-08 Time Stamps
7. CA-05 Plan of Action and Milestones | Automation Support for Accuracy and Currency

## Data Encryption

Robust encryption mechanisms are in place for both data at rest and in transit within the database. Industry-standard encryption algorithms such as Gnupg have been implemented to fortify data protection measures. All stored data is encrypted, safeguarding it from unauthorized access, even in the event of physical storage compromise. Schema modifications, query adjustments, and configurations were made to support and optimize encryption processes.

## Project Management Plan (PMP)

This project delivers a database with the implementation of NIST Risk Management Framework controls. With over a thousand entries and more than five users, the database comprises a minimum of seven tables. MySQL and SQL Workbench were used for database creation and control scheme implementation. The Project Management Plan was developed using Project Libre/Microsoft Project.
